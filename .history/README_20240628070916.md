# Rust-base code layout

This is an opinionated way to start a rust project

## Initialise the project

Initialise a rust project in the current folder

```bash
cargo init
```

This is how `cargo.toml` looks like initially.
`cargo.toml` - This is called a manifest, and it contains all of the metadata that Cargo needs to compile your package.

```toml
[package]
name = "rust-base"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
```

### Dependencies

Dependencies to add
First we add thiserror for error handling under dependencies

```toml
thiserror = "1"
```

If you intend to use async add tokio

```toml
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

If you are doing a command line interface you may use

```toml
clap = { version = "4", features = ["cargo"] }
```

### Dev dependencies

Add dev dependencies
anyhow - good for unit tests, examples and benchmarks

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
anyhow = "1"
```

### Full `cargo.toml` file

```toml
[package]
name = "rust-base"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }

[dev-dependencies]
anyhow = "1"
```

Now run

```bash
cargo build
```

Then

```bash
cargo run
```

Or

```bash
./target/debug/rust-base
```
